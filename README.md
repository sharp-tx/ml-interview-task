# ML Interview Task

Task for roles requiring machine learning expertise. We understand technical tasks can take time, especially when you are interviewing multiple companies.  We have decided on a review style task as we believe this is lighter and meets the same goal. Please read through and take notes. We will use this as discussion point in the technical interview.

It consists of:

- ML code review


This is to understand your level of experience building models pipelines using the typical sklearn package. We want to know wether you can identify flaws and discover opportunities for improvement, wether large or small. Please read through and write up notes on what would change or how you'd rework it. We will use this as a center point for wider ML questions.

- Python Coding


This is to see wether you are comfortable with Python and know how to assess models beyond AUC measures. If you're bursting with ideas and not time, feel free to finish with bullet points.

- A Relevant Discussion


Nothing explicit to do. It's something we will inevitably talk about as this model and its improvement is a key company goal.
