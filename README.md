# ML Interview Task

Task for roles requiring machine learning expertise. We understand technical tasks can take time, especially when you are interviewing multiple companies.  We have decided on a review style task as we believe this is lighter and meets the same goal. Feedback would be appreciated.

It consists of:
- ML code review
To understand your level of experience building models pipelines using the typical sklearn package. We want to know wether you can identify flaws and discover opportunities for improvement, wether large or small. Please read through and write up notes as you go on what would change or how you'd rework it. HINT: we haven't done a good job...

- Python Coding Challenge
This is to see wether you are comfortable with Python and know how to assess models beyond AUC measures. If you're bursting with ideas and not time, feel free to write bullet points.

- An Extremely Relevant Discussion
Nothing to do here except a heads up. It's something we will inevitably talk about as this model and its improvement is a key company goal.
